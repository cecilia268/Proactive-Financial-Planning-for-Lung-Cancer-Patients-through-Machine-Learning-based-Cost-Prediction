# Proactive-Financial-Planning-for-Lung-Cancer-Patients-through-Machine-Learning-based-Cost-Prediction

Iryss offers personalized solutions to lower your out-of-pocket costs and safeguard your finances from high cost medical conditions
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can help cancer patients proactively plan for future out-of-pocket costs. 
The project specifically aims to model the annual out-of-pocket costs for Stage 3 & 4 Lung Cancer patients from the year of diagnosis until the terminal year (death),
taking into consideration various relevant factors.
The ultimate aim is to reduce the financial burden of cancer diagnosis and treatment by providing patients with a better understanding of their future medical expenses.
